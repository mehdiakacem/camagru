<p class="intro">Camagru is a small web application that allows users to capture or
    upload photos, apply overlays, and share them publicly in a gallery
    where others can like and comment.
    It is inspired by Instagram`s core features and built to demonstrate
    full-stack web application design using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
